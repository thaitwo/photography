    <h3>HELLO!</h3><br>
    <p>Welcome to my photography website! I'm Thai, a photography enthusiast.</p><br>
    <p>I got into photography back in 2013 when I bought my first DSLR camera, a Canon T3i. Ever since, capturing cool sceneries and memorable life moments have been a hobby and passion of mine.</p><br>
    <p>Aside from photography, I also enjoy playing tennis and basketball, outdoor activities, doing anything adventurous, and being web developer.</p><br>
