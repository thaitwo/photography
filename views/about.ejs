    <h3>HELLO!</h3><br>
    <p>Thanks for checking out my website! My name is Thai and I am a photography enthusiast.</p><br>
    <p>I started photography back in 2012 when I bought my first DSLR camera (Canon T3i). Ever since, capturing amazing sceneries and life moments have been a big hobby and passion of mine. I also really enjoy editing the photos in post-processing as it allows me to be creative with my photography.</p><br>
    <p>Aside from photography, I also enjoy playing tennis, basketball, outdoor activities, and doing anything adventurous.</p><br>
